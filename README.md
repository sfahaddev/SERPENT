# SERPENT üêç



## Description

SERPENT is a GUI-based snake game created in C++ as part of a second-semester project. This project marked a significant milestone as it was not only my first programming project but also one where I took the lead. The game features two levels: Easy and Hard, providing players with varying levels of challenge and excitement.

## Features

- Intuitive and interactive GUI.
- Two levels: Easy and Hard.
- Smooth snake controls for an immersive gaming experience.
- Eat to grow: Guide the snake to consume food and watch it grow longer.
- Avoid collisions: Be cautious and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- Track your high scores separately for each level.

2. Run the game on your computer.
3. Choose the preferred level: Easy or Hard.
